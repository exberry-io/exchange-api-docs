# Introduction

The interface is a point-to-point service based on the technology and industry standards TCP/IP, FIXT and FIX.\
The session and application event models and messages are based on versions FIXT1.1 and FIX5.0 (SP 2) respectively.

#### **FIX API Overview**

The FIX API is designed for clients who have prior experience with **FIX protocol integration**.\
If your team is not familiar with FIX, we recommend using the **Exberry proprietary WebSocket API**, which is easier to integrate and requires less protocol-specific expertise.

The **Exberry FIX Gateway** provides participants with the following capabilities:

* **Trading** – Submit order commands and receive real-time execution reports.
* **Drop Copy** – Receive real-time copies of order activity and trade reports.
* **Market Data** – Subscribe to various types of live market data feeds.

The interface is a **point-to-point service** built on standard technologies including **TCP/IP**, **FIXT**, and **FIX** protocols.

* **Session Layer:** Based on **FIXT 1.1**
* **Application Layer:** Based on **FIX 5.0 SP2**

This ensures compatibility with industry-standard FIX implementations and tools.
