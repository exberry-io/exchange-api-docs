# Introduction

The exberry exchange API offers real time market data as well as the ability to trade with the exchange.&#x20;

The underlying technology used is [Scalecube](https://scalecube.github.io/) a Novel Open-source application-platform that addresses inherent challenges involved in the development of distributed computing.

Exchange API protocol is WebSocket.\
Any request body should be a valid `JSON`, non valid `JSON` objects will be ignored.

Within the valid `JSON` please be aware that:

* System ignores any additional parameter that was sent on request body but was not specified in this document.
* In case of multiple parameters sent with different values, system will always use the last value provided.

### **Request Parameters**

<table><thead><tr><th width="134.33333333333331">Parameter</th><th width="81">Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>q</td><td>String</td><td>qualifier, contains the method for the specific API call.</td></tr><tr><td>sid</td><td>Int</td><td>stream identifier, for each WebSocket connection this is a unique identifier for the API call. Please note that as long as the sid was not ended (other by exchange or by consumer) this canâ€™t be used again on the same WebSocket connection</td></tr><tr><td>d</td><td>Json</td><td>data object, contain the request body</td></tr></tbody></table>

```javascript
{ 
 "q":"exchange.market/placeOrder", 
 "sid":1, 
 "d": 
   { 
     Object
   } 
}
```

### **Success Response**

The response will always include the `q` and `sid` parameters from request and a `d` parameter with the response body.

```javascript
{ 
   "q":"exchange.market/placeOrder", 
   "sid":1, 
   "d": 
     { 
       Object
     } 
}
```

In case of short living stream (i.e. trading action), additional response will be sent upon stream closure with success, this message will include the `q` and `sid` parameters from request and `sig:1`.

```javascript
{
  "sig": 1,
  "q": "exchange.market/createSession",
  "sid": 1
}
```

### **Failure Response**

The response will always include the below parameters:

<table><thead><tr><th width="146">Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>sig</td><td>signal will be equal to "2"</td></tr><tr><td>q</td><td>from request</td></tr><tr><td>errorType</td><td>internal error type that should be ignored</td></tr><tr><td>sid</td><td>from request</td></tr><tr><td>d</td><td>data that contain errorCode and errorMessage.<br>Those are the error code and message to consider.</td></tr></tbody></table>

```javascript
{
  "sig": 2,
  "q": "exchange.market/createSession",
  "errorType": "401",
  "sid": 1,
  "d": {
    "errorCode": 6002,
    "errorMessage": "Missing fields: 'apiKey'"
  }
}
```

### **Stream Closure**

In order to close active stream need to send a message with `sig:3` in addition to `q` and `sid` from request.

```javascript
{
  "sig": 3,
  "q": "exchange.market/orderBookDepth",
  "sid": 100
}
```

sig parameter summary table:

<table><thead><tr><th width="89">sig</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Stream closed with success</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Stream closed with failure</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Stream was closed due to consumer request</td></tr></tbody></table>
